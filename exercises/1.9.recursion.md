# Exercise 1.9

The first procedure is recursive as it requires to solve each recursive call
before returning, as opposed to the second procedure which is iterative, because
it utilizes the **invariant** design (encapsulates state as another argument,
avoiding chaining operations), which can be optimized with tail recursion, and
become iterative.

First procedure process:

```scm
; (+ a b)
(inc (inc (inc (inc (inc (+ (dec a) b))))))
```

Second procedure process:

```scm
; (+ a b)
(+ (dec a) (inc b))
(+ (dec a) (inc b))
(+ (dec a) (inc b))
(+ (dec a) (inc b))
(+ (dec a) (inc b))
```
