# Exercise 2.9

The $width$ of an interval is defined as
$width = \frac{interval_u - interval_l}{2}$.

By the previous exercise, the substraction of intervals can be derived by
following Alyssa P. Hacker's reasoning, selecting the values which yield the
minimum and maximum bounds correspondingly.

$$
\begin{aligned}
C = A - B\\
C_l = A_l - B_u\\
C_u = A_u - B_l
\end{aligned}
$$

The substraction can also be defined in terms of the additive inverse, by
following the reasoning that intervals are simply a scalar, $o$, with $width$,
$w$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
I_l = o - w\\
I_u = o + w\\
-I_l = -o - w = -I_u\\
-I_u = -o + w = -I_l
\end{aligned}
$$

Which is equivalent to the previous definition of substraction.

$$
\begin{aligned}
C = A + (-B)\\
C_l = A_l + (-B)_l = A_l - B_u\\
C_u = A_u + (-B)_u = A_u - B_l
\end{aligned}
$$

In the addittion of intervals the $width$ will always be the addition of the
previous widths.

$$
\begin{aligned}
C = A + B\\
C_l = A_l + B_u = A_o + B_o - A_w - B_w\\
C_u = A_u + B_l = A_o + B_o + A_w + B_w\\
C_w = \frac{C_u - C_l}{2}\\
C_w = \frac{A_o + B_o + A_w + B_w - (A_o + B_o - A_w - B_w)}{2}\\
C_w = \frac{2A_w + 2B_w}{2}\\
C_w = A_w + B_w
\end{aligned}
$$

Subtracting affects the interval as if it were an addition, since negating an
interval leaves the $width$ unchanged.

This is not the case for multiplication or division, as the $width$ after thoose
operations is not only a function of itself, in other words it depends on the
origin as welltion of itself.

$$
\begin{aligned}
A_o = 0, A_w = 1\\
B_o = 0, B_w = 1\\
C = A * B\\
C_o = 0, C_w = 1
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
A_o = 0, A_w = 1\\
B_o = 1, B_w = 1\\
C = A * B\\
C_o = 0, C_w = 2
\end{aligned}
$$
