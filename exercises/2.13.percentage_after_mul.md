# Exercise 2.13

In the representation of center-percentage of intervals, the resulting
percentage of a multiplication can be expressed solely as an expression of the
previous percentages, only if the conditions that the intervals are small enough
(less than 100%) and all numbers are positive.

First we show that the two conditions must be met in order to give the
expression. If the percentages were greater than 100% then the sign of intervals
would be inverted, which would make for one of the nine cases seen in exercise
2.11. The same applies for the condition of both intervals being positive.

Here is the expression for the new percentage, $e_x$ means the percentage of
interval $x$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
c_l = a_l b_l\\
c(1 - e_c) = a(1 - e_a) b(1 - e_b)\\
\frac{ab}{c} = \frac{(1 - e_c)}{(1 - e_a) (1 - e_b)}\\
\\
c_u = a_u b_u\\
c(1 + e_c) = a(1 + e_a) b(1 + e_b)\\
(1 + e_c) = \frac{ab}{c} (1 + e_a) (1 + e_b)\\
(1 + e_c) = \frac{(1 - e_c)(1 + e_a) (1 + e_b)}{(1 - e_a) (1 - e_b)}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

Say that.

$$
v = \frac{(1 + e_a) (1 + e_b)}{(1 - e_a) (1 - e_b)}
$$

Then.

$$
\begin{aligned}
(1 + e_c) = (1 - e_c) u\\
(1 + e_c) - (1 - e_c) u = 0\\
e_c + u e_c + 1 - u = 0\\
e_c(1 + u) = u -1\\
e_c = \frac{u -1}{(1 + u)}\\
\end{aligned}
$$
