# Exercise 2.76

The explicit dispatch is problematic on the addition of new types, as every
operation must be changed for a single addition. Message passing is the
opposite, it facilitates the addition of types and requires the modification of
dispatch functions in every type constructor. Explicit dispatch is better than
message passing on operation addition as it can handle any amount of parameters.
The data-directed style is generally better, as it simplifies the addition of
both operations, at the penalty of some boilerplate code, this approach seems
similar to OOP polymorphism.
