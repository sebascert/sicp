# Exercise 2.72

In the case of the most frequent symbol, it takes $\theta(n)$, as it first
searchs in the left branch, which contains the set of only the most frequent
symbol.

In the case of the least frequent symbol, the algorithm goes over $n-1$ levels
of the tree , and searches an $n$ set of elements $n = n_l + n_r$ for each
level, hence the order of growth is $\theta(n^2)$.
