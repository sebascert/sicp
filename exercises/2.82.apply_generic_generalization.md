# Exercise 2.82

The problem presented is to generalize for the case of operations on any amount
of arguments of any type.

The naive attempt of coercing every argument to a single type is not enough as
there may be operations with multiple different types, where some coercion from
the given types to the operation types exists.

A valid solution would be to attempt coercing the arguments, with possibly
multiple coercions, to every possible combination supported by the operation,
which would eventually yield a one of the valid type permutations. this process
would have $\theta(k^n)$ complexity, for $k$ types and $n$ arguments.

Although approach may seem to solve the problem, it's very impractical, as
operations would have to perform an expensive lookup for each call, and it's
full of inconsistencies, as choosing between valid coercions is impossible
without a hierarchy graph, and even with it, there are ambiguous situations such
as the diamond problem in OOP.
