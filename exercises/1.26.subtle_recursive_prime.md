# Exercise 1.26

Louis Reasoner code:

```scm
(define (expmod base exp m)
 (cond
  ((= exp 0)
   1)
  ((even? exp)
   (remainder (* (expmod base (/ exp 2) m) (expmod base (/ exp 2) m)) m))
  (else
   (remainder (* base (expmod base (- exp 1) m)) m))))
```

The reason why the implementation is now $\theta(n)$ is because in the case in
which the exponent is even, we divide our exponent by half but duplicate the
operation, as it's called twice, cancelling the effect caused by dividing it in
the first place.
