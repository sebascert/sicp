# Exercise 2.63

First procedure.

```scheme
(define (tree->list-1 tree)
 (if (null? tree)
   nil
  (append (tree->list-1 (left-branch tree))
          (cons (entry tree) (tree->list-1 (right-branch tree))))))
```

Second procedure.

```scheme
(define (tree->list-2 tree)
 (define (copy-to-list tree result-list)
  (if (null? tree)
   result-list
   (copy-to-list
    (left-branch tree)
    (cons (entry tree) (copy-to-list (right-branch tree) result-list)))))

 (copy-to-list tree  nil))
```

They both produce the same list for every tree, but the first is recursive and
the second is iterative.
