# Exercise 1.25

The trivial solution would work for small numbers, but there are 2 problems with
it:

1. Possible number overflow without the remainder operation.
2. Efficiency loss by operating on unlimited size numbers, operations such as
   division or multiplication would no longer be $\theta(n)$.
